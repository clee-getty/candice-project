At its core, Plato and Aristotle’s competing conceptions of “the good” represent the tension between abstract and practical definitions of human existence. In their respective philosophical works, Plato and Aristotle sought to answer the fundamental questions of ethics: Does a universal definition of the good exist? If so, what does it mean to live a good life? Through his Socratic dialogues, Plato constructs a non-naturalist notion of good as the highest form, from which all other abstract forms derive their value and meaning. In contrast, Aristotle frames his theory of good around practical considerations, arguing that humans achieve eudaimonia through the habitual cultivation of virtues. 

To understand Plato’s abstract theory of forms, we must first establish his argument for the existence of innate ideas. In Meno, Socrates hypothesizes that virtue may be inborn, proposing an experiment where Meno’s slave boy tries to prove a complicated mathematical proposition (x2 + y2 = z2) without prior knowledge. To Meno’s surprise, his slave boy succeeds (albeit with some prompting by Socrates), suggesting that certain concepts must be innate and that such knowledge can be accessed through proper reasoning. Socrates concludes that if all abstract concepts are innate, and virtue is an abstract concept, then virtue must also be innate. As such, we can begin to understand virtue in the same way we derive mathematical concepts — through philosophical inquiry. 

Having established the existence of some abstract good, Plato endeavors to strip his argument of vagueness and derive a conclusive definition of the good. According to Plato, there are four cardinal virtues that characterize the state of the soul: wisdom, courage, moderation, and justice. In the Republic, Plato centers his discussion of ethics around three critics of Socrates, who each propose their own notions of justice. Thrasymachus, the most fervent objector, contends that “justice is nothing other than what is advantageous for the stronger,” pointing out the practical shortcomings of assuming a single definition of justice.[^1] For example, a shepherd does not care for his animals out of the kindness of his heart, but to preserve his own livelihood. If the shepherd is only acting in his own interest, how can his actions be considered just? Here, Socrates recognizes that the existence of justice itself cannot confirm its singularity. 

To prove that justice is loved for itself and its consequences, Socrates investigates justice in the individual writ large upon the city. Socrates observes three classes in a city — rulers, military, and citizens — who correspond to three desires — reason, spirit, and bodily appetites. When each class devotes themselves to their individual satisfaction and collaborates hierarchically, the city achieves justice. Through this division of labor, we see that justice is in the best interest of each class, who perform the tasks best suited to their disposition. As such, Plato concludes that a just individual learns to balance the pleasures of the tripartite soul, guiding spirit and appetite with reason.

With this argument, Plato succeeds in giving a concrete example of a moral form that is both non-natural and instantiated in the natural world. If we can derive an abstract form of justice, Socrates tells Glaucon that “the last thing to be seen is the form of the good.”[^2] In Book VII of the Republic, Plato illustrates this idea through the Allegory of the Cave, where prisoners are chained to a cave and positioned to face a wall from childhood. As a fire burns behind them, the prisoners watch the shadows of puppeteers on the wall, giving the shadows names and recognizing the distorted forms as their physical reality. When a prisoner is freed from the cave, he observes the true form of things under the sun, reasoning that the truth of the world had been obscured by his naïve dependence on sensory perception. In this parable, Plato suggests that the good illuminates all knowledge, and ignorance of its existence traps the individual in an illusion of truth. Thus, Plato concludes that the good exists as the highest form, from which individual objects subsume their goodness. He encourages us to free ourselves from illusion like the escaped prisoner, using reason and philosophical inquiry to contemplate abstract forms and to get conceptually closer to the good. In essence, Plato’s account of justice and abstract forms assert that knowledge of the good presupposes moral behavior. 

Under Plato’s theory of ethics, we should be able to derive the good of every object by finding the ways in which it conforms to a common abstraction of good. Here, a difficulty arises. How practical is it to derive the goodness of simple objects from the form of good? If it took Plato writing the entire Republic to understand the nature of justice, how should we go about understanding the forms of everyday objects? If we were to compare a painting and a city, what shared characteristics make both of them “good”? Plato might say that a good painting and a good city both contribute to culture, and that we can evaluate them based on their ability to achieve this end. This hardly seems like a satisfying answer. How then, should we define a good contribution to culture? The cycle is endless. Despite the repetitive prospect of investigating the practical application of forms, Plato might argue that these difficulties are a necessary aspect of philosophical inquiry. Perhaps my unwillingness to pursue the path toward understanding a universal good represents a disposition unsuited for philosophy, and as such, I should focus on the subjects that I am more favorably disposed to. 

This proposition creates a further problem for Plato’s framework, as knowledge of the good is necessary for moral behavior. If I am indisposed to philosophical inquiry, and thus should not attempt to overstep my boundaries and keep my soul in harmony, should I just live ignorantly? According to Plato, we have a responsibility to seek knowledge, but we also must perform the role best suited for us; thus, those uninclined to engage in philosophical inquiry should practice moral virtue by emulating virtuous individuals and cultivate good habits through self-discipline. In the context of the real world, such advice is vague at best. If someone does not even know what the good is, how can they choose a virtuous person to emulate? If so, would it be fair for others to judge me morally if I lack knowledge of the good? 

Plato believes that ignorant individuals can still be held accountable for their actions because objective standards of right and wrong exist. However, this is not always the case. Imagine a building that starts to collapse after an earthquake. An office-worker, Pete, tells everyone to take the stairs instead of the elevator, because he is worried the elevator will malfunction as a result of the earthquake. Those taking the stairs take too long and get buried alive under rubble, while those who risked taking the elevator survive. In this situation, Pete acted logically and intended to save people with his advice. Yet, he lacked knowledge of the good, and as a result, lots of people died. No one would blame Pete for his mistake, but Plato’s theory says we should hold everyone accountable to objective standards of right and wrong, which, in such situations, seems unjust.

Unsatisfied with Platonist ethics, Aristotle creates a competing conception of good from his understanding of taxonomy, denying that forms exist independently of the objects that exemplify them. To understand Aristotle’s theory of ethics, we must first define the conceptual role of eudaimonia. According to Aristotle, eudaimonia is the highest good for man, representing a state of well-being attached to the soul. As such, an individual could have failing health but still exist in a perfect state of eudaimonia. For example, Stephen Hawking became paralyzed as a result of ALS, but we still have a sense of him achieving a higher state of well-being as a scientist and a family man. Accordingly, though we are constrained by our physical abilities and natural dispositions, goodness is relative to its beholder and thus attainable by everyone. Rather than a form that is indifferent with respect to its subject, the good as Aristotle conceives it can be systematically derived through observations of the physical world.

In Nicomachean Ethics, Aristotle expands on this idea, devising a practical system for defining the good for every object. The first line of the book, Aristotle appears to commit a logical fallacy: 

> “Every craft and every line of inquiry, and likewise every action and decision, seem to seek some good, that is why some people were right to describe the good as what everything seeks.”[^3] 

In other words, Aristotle states that “something bears F to everything because everything bears F to something,” which is an incorrect statement. For example, if every hunter is aiming at a duck, we cannot infer that there is a duck at which all hunters aim. As such, if all human activities aim for good, we also cannot say there is a good at which all humans aim. To clarify this apparent fallacy, Aristotle continues to say that something is pronounced good relative to its kind, so the good at which everything aims would be the product of being a good example of its kind. For example, a good dog is a good example of the canine kind. This solves one of the fundamental problems with Plato’s theory of ethics, which had trouble finding the universal good of everyday objects. If we use the example from earlier, Aristotle would simply say that a good painting is a good example of its kind, just as a good city is a good example of its kind, which is a much more practical concept.

To apply Aristotle’s conception of ethics, we must (1) define the thing we have, and (2) we must ask what makes it a good example of its kind. With this formula, Aristotle makes two important distinctions. Human beings are (1) rational animals, so we must (2) show in our beliefs that we are reasonable. Ethics (1) holds usually but not universally, so in dealing with ethics we must (2) seek happiness and well-being (i.e., eudaimonia). Though Aristotle agrees with Plato that of the three desires, reason must rule the soul, humans do not use their reason to arrive at truth, but rather practice reason to internalize virtue. As such, Aristotle rejects Plato’s doctrine of innate ideas, arguing instead that individuals learn virtue to maximize pleasure, as virtuous actions are intrinsically pleasurable. In turn, failing to act in accordance with reason causes misery, conditioning the soul to favor virtue. Thus, to live a good life, we develop our nature through habituation, becoming temperate by performing temperate acts and gaining courage by performing courageous acts. After an individual undergoes proper habituation, their mind and body gain a sort of “muscle memory,” making virtuous actions seem natural.

Consider the reception of Van Gogh's art during his lifetime. If we consider him a master of his craft and a pioneer of Impressionism, why was he not recognized during his time? Aristotle would argue that critics did not accurately distinguish the kind of art Van Gogh was creating, and as such, failed to recognize Van Gogh's mastery of his craft. For example, Van Gogh's *The Potato Eaters* was torn apart for its unappealing color palette and anatomically incorrect figures. However, Van Gogh's letters revealed that he was nontheless satisfied with the painting, because his goal was to impart a message rather than showcase technical perfection. Unlike his contemporary Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot, who painted peasants against charming backdrops and soft colors, Van Gogh sought to depict the harsh reality faced by peasants, fighting back against the oblivious underpinnings of highly polished pictorial styles.

Here, one might ask how to start the process of habituation and how to mechanically define virtue before it feels natural. To address this vagueness, Aristotle locates all human virtues in a matrix, where we identify the “mean between extremes” and act accordingly. Rather than a simplistic calculation, we find the mean through careful reasoning, deriving a course of action that is logical in our physical context. Imagine yourself as a kid in middle school. You see an eighth grader bullying a sixth grader. If you charge in to protect the sixth grader, you would be acting recklessly, because you could get hurt and end up in trouble. If you stay a bystander and walk briskly to class, you would be acting cowardly, because you have chosen to ignore an unjust situation. Thus, the best option is calling a teacher over to help the sixth grader and punish the eighth grader, where you exhibit courage by speaking out against bullying without endangering yourself. Aristotle states that there are only two exceptions to this rule: (1) not every action produces a mean, and (2) some actions are always wrong. For example, (1) you cannot have an excess or deficiency of virtue, and (2) murder is not a matter of performing an action the right way.

Using this formula, Aristotle draws a comparison between moral well-being and physical well-being, both of which require context for us to choose the mean between extremes. When we choose how much is right to eat, each individual will have a different answer based on their stature and level of physical activity. Thus, there is no true standard for health but to make wise choices based on our physical situations. Similarly, we cannot create a precise answer for virtue, which like health, exists in a range. Aristotle points out that in reality, there are many factors involved in our decisions, including those factors we are not aware of. Because of the uncertainty we face in making choices, Aristotle asserts the importance of teachers for cultivating good in a society, helping their students learn to use their gifts and become a successful example of a good human being. 

Thus far, we have evaluated Plato and Aristotle’s competing conceptions of the good, tracing Plato’s non-naturalist theory of ethics through his Socratic dialogues and Aristotle’s naturalist notion of good in Nicomachean Ethics. Though both philosophers believe living a good life requires reason, Plato believes humans inquire toward an innate good, while Aristotle believes humans use reason to habituate their individual definitions of well-being. In evaluating each argument, I find Aristotle’s argument is more representative of practical situations, where humans cultivate virtue through action. As such, I am more inclined to believe that happiness (or eudaimonia) represents an active and thoughtful engagement with life, rather than a uniform goal to strive for.
