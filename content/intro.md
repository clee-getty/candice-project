If you’ve ever visited the Getty Center, you’ve likely wandered into the West Pavilion, where never-ending crowds have become a defining feature of the gallery. Knowing what it holds, it’s not hard to see why. The Impressionist room hosts some of the Getty’s most famous and expensive works, including masterpieces like Van Gogh’s *Irises* (last sold for $53.9 million) and Manet’s *Jeanne (Spring)* (acquired for $65.1 million).[^1] As the art market continues to skyrocket, the intrinsic value of art comes into question. When we visit galleries filled with multi-million-dollar acquisitions, what are we really admiring? Has market value become conflated with moral virtue?

In this publication, I will examine the complex interplay between art, aesthetics, and ethics, evaluating the capacity of prominent western ethical theories for defining what truly constitutes a “good” piece of art. From Aristotle’s virtue ethics to Kant’s moral realism, we will test the relevance of each ethical framework in a modern context.
